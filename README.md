## ðŸŒŸ About HAN

**HAN (Korean Heritage Augmented Narrative Visual-Language Description Dataset)** is a new large-scale visual-language dataset focused on Korea's rich cultural heritage. This dataset comprises images paired with detailed, narrative captions in both Korean and English.

The HAN dataset aims to support research objectives such as:
*   Developing visual-language models with a deep understanding of Korean cultural heritage.
*   Enhancing the ability to generate narrative and contextual descriptions beyond simple image tagging.
*   Advancing multilingual (Korean/English) visual-language processing capabilities.
*   Promoting research in culturally specialized AI models.
